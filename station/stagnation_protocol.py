Stagnation Protocol System (simplified)

stagnation levels (Stagnation I, II, III, ...) every fixed interval without
score improvements. It broadcasts a single protocol message at each level and
returns to Healthy on any breakthrough.

# Default Protocol I message
DEFAULT_PROTOCOL_I_MESSAGE = """**Architect Message**

This is a station-wide announcement:

The Station has entered a stage of stagnation, as no breakthroughs have been achieved for many ticks. 

Cease your current work and execute the following **Stagnation Protocol**. Run each step on **separate Station ticks**:

### 1. **Literature Review**

Go to the Archive Room and ask the Surveyor for a targeted survey of the current frontier. Include your current research direction or hypotheses in the prompt, and ask the Surveyor to identify relevant successful mechanisms, scoped failures, important papers to read, and gaps or consensus views worth challenging.

Read several key papers cited by the Surveyor in full detail. Around 3–5 papers is a good number to start with. Do not run `preview all` as the default first action, as it may cause information overload and reinforce existing blind spots.

Then summarize the papers and research landscape in a new Private Memory Capsule. Focus on the current state of the art, common approaches, open challenges, gaps in prior work, and insights gained. For important negative results, record what they actually cover and what nearby regimes remain open.

This step should take several Station ticks. Make sure to document your findings thoroughly. Skip this step if you are an immature agent.

### 2. **Assumption-challenging Reflection**

It has been observed that a Station can become trapped in a local conceptual paradigm due to influential archival papers, existing SOTA methods, or repeated negative results. Run a multi-tick reflection based on the papers you have read and your own research journey. Reflect upon:

* Are there opposing schools of thought within the Station, similar to those in the human research community? If not, what is the dominant school of thought, and what are its blind spots?
* Which assumptions or archival papers have not been challenged conceptually, but should be? This should be at the conceptual level, e.g. existing taxonomies, foundational assumptions, or favored representations.
* Which assumptions or archival papers have not been challenged technically, but should be? This should be at the technical level, e.g. specific hypotheses, model restrictions, search spaces, or proof assumptions in existing methods.
* Which archive papers or evaluation histories are being treated as if they killed an entire paradigm? What is the exact logical gap between the paper’s formal claim and the broader paradigm?
* Can any negative result be inverted into a positive design principle? For example, does the obstruction identify which assumption to relax, which structure to preserve, or which nearby family remains open?
* If these assumptions are broken, what concrete research role, revival lane, or construction direction should exist that does not currently exist?

Remember that even published papers with high scores, widely accepted taxonomies, or paradigms deemed futile after many negative results should be challenged critically. Stagnation is often caused not only by lack of effort, but by blind spots induced by the existing literature.

### 3. **Novel Exploration Reflection**

Run another multi-tick reflection, this time focused on brainstorming novel ideas for the original problem, informed by your assumption-challenging reflection. This may include:

* Consider methods for breaking the assumptions identified in the previous reflection.
* Consider similar problems, simpler versions of the problem, or even unrelated lines of investigation that might not initially seem helpful but could lead to useful insights.
* Consider cross-disciplinary ideas or analogies that might inspire a breakthrough. Use looser forms of reasoning, such as metaphors, speculative models, or anthropomorphic descriptions, if they help generate novel ideas. Do not reject unusual ideas too early; first translate them into possible technical hypotheses, representations, or construction strategies.
* Brainstorm at least three novel ideas based on the above reflections.

You should develop a concrete research plan at the end of the reflection. The research plan should cover all the promising ideas you generate above, instead of being restricted to a single idea. It should span at least 60 ticks and include a timetable and contingency plans.

### 4. **Execution**

Execute the above research plan. 

* If you have been assigned a supervisor: You should ask your supervisor for permission to pivot if your current line of research is materially different from the new research plan. You may run some preliminary exeriments before asking for a pivot, so as to select the most promising direction.
* You should be persistent in following your research plan and should not pivot once it has started. Early failure should be expected.

## Stagnation Holiday

- To facilitate reflection and long-term planning, the next 5 ticks (till Station Tick __HOLIDAY_END_TICK__) will be declared a holiday, where you cannot goto the Research Center or submit new papers.
- You should spend the holiday to execute the first three steps of the Stagnation Protocol, which will prepare you for the next execution phase after the holiday.
- If you have time left in the holiday after completing the first three steps, you can use it to further reflect or discuss more with peers.

### For Supervisors

Supervisors must also execute the above steps (except Step 4 - Execution) and guide agents in completing the Stagnation Protocol:

- Supervisors must encourage agents to pursue high-risk, novel exploration instead of exploiting known methods or local optima. Multiple component changes and regime changes are encouraged. 
- Try to cultivate a diverse research community with opposing schools of thought and a willingness to challenge assumptions, especially established Station knowledge. Encourage agents to think and speak bluntly rather than diplomatically.
- Do not overemphasize rigor. Rigorous protocols or tools must not block novel attempts. Do not focus on scoping claims except when agents are ready to submit archival papers.
- Do not overemphasize short-term score optimization. A new paradigm may take a long time (>100 ticks) to catch up with the established paradigm, so do not let the agent give up because of a few low scores.
- The requirement for the score transfer hypothesis in the Research Proposal can be relaxed to mitigate score-chasing bias.
- The usual high bar for a pivot request may be temporarily relaxed at the start of the Stagnation Protocol.
- The usual requirement of only a single direction per Research Proposal can be relaxed to allow multiple promising directions to be explored in parallel during the Stagnation Protocol.
